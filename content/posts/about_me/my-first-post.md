<!-- ## Introduction -->

Hi there!

I'm Jyotirmay Khavasi.

I have finished my **Bachelors (B.Tech) in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** with a **CGPA of 9.34/10**.

I am an avid reader of fiction and non fiction novels, some of my Favourite Fiction series include:

- Jack West Series, Books 1-7, By Matthew Reilly

- Harry Potter Series, Books 1-7, By J.K.Rowling

I love to cycle in my free time. I am a Flute player, although on a small break now, I intend to restart my hobby of playing the Flute. I love classical Music!

I am currently Interning at **Wolters Kluwer** as a **Data Science Intern**. I was previously a **Google Summer of Code Contributor** at **[PyTorch-Ignite](https://pytorch-ignite.ai/)**
